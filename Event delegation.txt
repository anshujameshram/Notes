Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element, and handle events from its child elements through event bubbling.

Instead of adding event listeners to every child individually, you use one on the parent and detect which child triggered the event.

How It Works (Event Bubbling)-
-----------------------------------------
Event delegation relies on event bubbling:

When an event occurs on an element, it bubbles up the DOM tree.
The event can be caught by a listener on any ancestor.
Using event.target, we can check which element actually triggered the event.


Why Event Delegation Is Useful-
----------------------------------
âœ… Pros:
Performance: One listener instead of many.

Dynamic Content: Handles child elements that are added or removed dynamically.

Cleaner Code: Reduces redundancy.


Real-Life Example
HTML:


<ul id="menu">
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
</ul>

JavaScript (Event Delegation):

document.getElementById("menu").addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
    alert("You clicked: " + event.target.textContent);
  }
});

Explanation:
#menu is the parent.
We attach one click listener to it.
Inside the handler, we use event.target to detect which <li> was clicked.
No need to add a listener to every <li>.


ðŸ“Œ When to Use Event Delegation
âœ… Use event delegation when:

You have a list of similar child elements.
The list may grow or change dynamically.
You want to minimize memory usage and improve performance.



example-


document.queryselector("#category").addEventListener("click",(e)=>{
console.log(e.target);
console.log(e.target.id);
if(e.target.tagName === "LI"){
	window.location.href="/"+e.target.id;  //localhost:8080/laptops
  }
})

<li id="category">
<ul >laptop</ul>
<ul>Home</ul>
<ul>shoes</ul>
</li>



example-

<form id="userForm">
  <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" /><br />
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" /><br />
  <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" /><br />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>



const form = document.getElementById("userForm");

form.addEventListener("input", function(event) {
  const target = event.target;

  // Check if the event came from an input field
  if (target.tagName === "INPUT") {
    console.log(`Field "${target.name}" changed to: ${target.value}`);
  }
});

form.addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
  event.preventDefault(); // prevent actual submission
  console.log("Form submitted!");
});


How It Works-
----------------
The input event is delegated to the form.
It listens for changes in any of the input fields.
Uses event.target to determine which field was changed.
Only one event listener is needed instead of one per input.


benefit-
-------------
1.memory - need to attach only one event listeners so it saves lot of memory.
2.writing less code - 
3.dom manipulation 


limitations-
there are lot of events which are not bubbled up- some events do not propogate the hierarchy.
